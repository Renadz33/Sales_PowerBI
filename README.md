I worked on a dashboard, and it was about analyzing sales data for an electronics store and explaining the ideas in it.

First, an overview of the data: The dashboard provides cards that contain comprehensive statistical information about important metrics such as the number of orders, total sales, and profits. This section provides a quick overview of the storeâ€™s overall performance.

Top Products: The most requested products are displayed, focusing on customer preferences and popular products from electronic devices.

Monthly and time-based trends: The dashboard displays a breakdown of orders by month and time and provides insights into peak demand periods. This information is important for timing advertising efforts to attract maximum audience attention.

Quarterly sales analysis: To understand sales performance throughout the year, this allows an accurate view of seasonal changes and helps in planning.

Classification of price categories: Prices are classified to distinguish demand patterns. This classification helps determine which categories have the highest demand.

Profit ratio by category: This insight not only helps in understanding revenue distribution but also helps in making decisions regarding pricing strategies.

By encapsulating these essential elements, the dashboard serves as a powerful tool for making informed decisions and strategic planning in the dynamic field of electronics sales.
